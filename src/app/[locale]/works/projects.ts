      description: "Drivers is an individual project developed during my training at SoyHenry. It is a Single Page Application that allows users to explore, filter, and manage Formula 1 drivers using data from an external API. I designed and built the entire frontend using React, Redux, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface. I also created a backend with Sequelize and PostgreSQL to store the drivers created by users through a form. This project helped me gain confidence in connecting APIs, managing global state with Redux, designing user-friendly interfaces, and implementing full CRUD functionality with a relational database."
